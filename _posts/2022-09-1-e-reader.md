This was/is a project to create a functioning E-reader for my partner, which would also allow for an external trigger for page turning. The project has had two main iterations, sadly I didn't chronicle the first iteration very well and have few images of it intact, to add insult to injury the CAD program I used to design it was a student version so the files are now useless to me. This repo contains the redesign using FreeCAD in which a wooden case (instead of 3d printed PLA) is used, along with all the software for running it. The GitHub repository containing all software, CAD and CAM data can be found [here](https://github.com/dtourolle/d-reader-public).

I have tried to document the development process, source code and CAD/CAM. If you are interested these are split between these pages. The software, CAD and CAM can be found here.
