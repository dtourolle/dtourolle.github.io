I built an e-reader for my partner who is an avid reader and was experiencing discomfort from hours of repetitive clicking on a kindle. The e-reader connects to a wearable and can be controlled via motion. The project has had two iterations, with the main differences being the enclosure design and construction. The first iteration was completed in spring 2020 during the first COVID lock down, while the second iteration was in spring 2022. [This repo](https://github.com/dtourolle/d-reader-public). contains the designs for the second iteration (designed using FreeCAD), along with all the software for running it.

I have tried to document the development process, source code and CAD/CAM, in some cases this is really retrospective. If you are interested these are split between these pages. If you are not interested in the story then the software, CAD and CAM can be found [here](https://github.com/dtourolle/d-reader-public).
