This site is about hobby projects I have created during my free time. I have tried to use this format to expand on my GitHub repos, giving more background to the motivations, problems and solutions in these projects. Why these posts might be interesting is because of my background in biomedical engineering, where I have been lucky enough to have had broad exposure to software engineering, mechanical design, electronic design and various manufacturing methods, which are applied in these project. In my [professional life](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dtourolle/) I have worked at imec-OnePlanet on biomedical algorithms for wearable devices, prior to this I worked as a researcher at ETH ZÃ¼rich writing multi-physics software for simulation of mechanobiology.
